= Should I continue optimizing and resizing with Photoshop? =
    Dont waste resizing and optimizing images in Photoshop. Plugin will reduce image size automatically!

= Why way2enjoy image optimizer credit is number instead of size ? =
It depends on algorithm. for example Optimus image optimizer, shortpixel image optimizer, ewww image optimizer, tinypng(compress jpeg & png images) counts each image as 1 credit however imagify image optimizer, kraken etc credit varies with size. WP Smush Image Compression and Optimization , resmush image optimizer, robin image optimizer does not do either.

= Google Pagespeed Insights still says my images need compressing and resizing? =
    Try lossy as it will save more. Scale down images. Scaling images just by setting width and height **under resize image setting** can save space and reduce image loading time. Decide right size and scale images down. Google pagespeed Insights decide based on quality 70 and we tries to reduce image size ensuring best possible visual quality. Ignore google pagespeed warning else manually change the default quality setting.

= How does the plugin work? =
    Way2enjoy image optimizer sends original images to Cloud for compression then downloads optimized images and unoptimized originals/thumbs are replaced with compressed images. 

= Do you optimize images in cloud? =
    Images processsed by w2e image optimizer are optimized in Cloud so no load on your site. 

= What is image compression? =
    Image compression is a type of data compression applied to digital images, to reduce their cost for storage or transmission. W2E image optimizer algorithms take advantage of visual perception and the statistical properties of image data to provide superior results

= Payment methods? =
    PayPal, Bitcoin, Payoneer.

= What is diff between baseline image and progressive JPEG? =
    Baseline image starts loading from top to bottom and progressive JPEG loads from low quality to high quality so without loading of full image, preview can be seen almost instantly. For websites, where loading time is most important factor, progressive images are preferred. Our image compression algorithm generates progressive jpeg. 

= How much is a credit? =
    Each time way2enjoy image optimizer optimizes an image or thumbnail credit is used. If we are unable to optimize image or thumbnail then no credit
	
=  Lossy or Lossless? =
    Lossy conversion is best as it will shrink image more at minimal loss.
    Lossless conversion will result in minor saving.With lossless google pagespeed will give warning so prefer lossy but every website is unique so decide between lossy and lossless. 
    Lossless will give 2-7% saving compared to lossy huge saving(upto 90%).

= Does optimizing images affect my ALT tags? =
    No, W2E image optimizer only optimize images.If width and height for resizing image is set, then we resize image in addition to compressing images. 

= Does sites like facebook, twitter, reddit, pinterest, youtube and amazon uses image optimisation ? =
    Almost all sites uses image optimisation to speedup site loading time and performance.W2E image optimizer quality is comparable to these companies.

= How to enable svg support ? =
    SVG files are vector images which scales well. In setting enable svg support which will allow you to upload svg files. You can disable anytime and svg support will be blocked. Tick it again to add svg files.

= How to include webp images ? =
    You can replace img tags with picture tags to include webp images.

= What is difference between JPEG, PNG and GIF images and how they are compressed ?=
    PNG can hold transparency of images,so it can be put on any frame and it will adjust in that image or block. We compress png with utmost care and maintains transparency even with lossy. GIF images can hold animation so when you need animation, choose gif format. We use best algorithm to compress gif and ensures that animation works. JPG or JPEG images are most widely used image format. Plugin decides optimum balance automatically to compress jpg so that you get best quality and best compression together. 

= Is it free ? =
    1000 images/month to compress and all unused credit will be carried forward.Refer and earn 2500 free credit instantly free of cost to both sites. Need more?? W2E image optimizer is affordable.

= optimize or optimise? =
    It depends. But whether you pronounce optimize, optimise, optimizer, crunch, minify, reducer or reduce size for better speed,seo and performance all are synonyms.

= How does video optimizer works ? =
    W2E image optimizer optimizes all video format. credit for video optimization and mp3 optimization are dynamic and not like image where 1 credit is used

= It will work in localhost? =
    No. 
	
= How does W2E image optimizer scheduling works =
    Say You have 10000 images, it requires time to optimize, just use W2E image optimizer schedule feature. Allow plugin to run every 60/120/300/600/900/1800/3600/86400 seconds all in background.Check the magic after few hours and W2E image optimizer just optimized all images.
